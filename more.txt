The veil has been lifted from the mysterious "Misha," the man Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev's family claims had a big part to play in radicalizing him.
Despite days of speculation — which involved rumors about Misha being a red-bearded Armenian Muslim-turned-FBI informant — nothing concrete surfaced until The New York Review of Books reported Sunday that they had found him.
In an interview with NYR's Christian Caryl, Misha, whose real name is reportedly Mikhail Allakhverdov, confirmed knowing Tamerlan Tsarnaev but denied having any role in the Boston bombings.
